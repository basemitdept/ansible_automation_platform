- ✅ Secure password handling

### 7. **Bug Fixes**
- ✅ Fixed duration calculation showing 180+ minutes
- ✅ Proper timezone handling for all timestamps

## 📁 **Files Added/Modified**

### Backend Files:
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added Flask-JWT-Extended
- `backend/models.py` - Added User model, user tracking, timezone fixes
- `backend/app.py` - Added auth routes, JWT setup, user permissions
- `backend/users_migration.sql` - Database migration for users table
- `backend/user_tracking_migration.sql` - Migration for user tracking columns
- `backend/run_user_migrations.sh` - Script to run all migrations

### Frontend Files:
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Added authentication flow, user dropdown, Users menu
- `frontend/src/components/Login.js` - NEW: Login page component
- `frontend/src/components/Users.js` - NEW: User management component  
- `frontend/src/utils/permissions.js` - NEW: Permission checking utilities
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added auth API and JWT interceptors
- `frontend/src/components/Playbooks.js` - Added permission-based UI

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions for New Environment**

1. **Copy the entire codebase** to your new location

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Apply database migrations:**
   ```bash
   ./backend/run_user_migrations.sh
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - URL: http://localhost
   - Default Login:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin`

## 🧪 **Testing the Implementation**

1. **Login Test:**
   - Go to http://localhost
   - Login with admin/admin
   - Verify you see the main dashboard

2. **User Management Test:**
   - Click "Users" in the left sidebar (bottom)
   - Create a new user with different roles
   - Test permissions for each role

3. **Task Tracking Test:**
   - Run a playbook
   - Check Running Tasks - should show current user
   - Check History - should show user who ran each task

4. **Duration Fix Test:**
   - Run a playbook
   - Watch the duration counter - should start from 0s

## 🔐 **Security Features**

- ✅ Password hashing using Werkzeug security
- ✅ JWT tokens with expiration
- ✅ Protected API endpoints
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM

## 📝 **Database Schema Changes**

### New Tables:
- `users` - User accounts and roles

### Modified Tables:
- `tasks` - Added `user_id` foreign key
